    <h3> Chapter 1: Why Scala? </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>A blend of functional and object-oriented statically-type language. The two programming styles have complementary strengths when it comes to scalability.</li>
      <li>Most things <i>feel</i> native, however, they're truly just library abstractions that can be extended and adapted.</li>
      <li>Two main ideas are basis for functional programming:
        <ol>
          <li>Funtions are first-class values.</li>
          <li>Operations of a program should map input values to output rather than changing data in-place.</li>
        </ol>   
      </li>
      <li>Scala is: compatible, concise, high-level and statically-typed.</li>
    </ol>
